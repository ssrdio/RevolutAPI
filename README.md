# API documentation
https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/merchant-api

https://developer.revolut.com/docs/business/business-api

API version: `2024-09-01`

# Supported API-s
* Business API 
* Merchant API

# Migrating to 4+
## Breaking changes 
### 1. Request Models Constructor Added

- Previously, request models were initialized using object initializers, e.g.,
  ```csharp
  CreateOrderReq orderRequest = new CreateOrderReq
  {
    Amount = 10,
    Currency = "EUR"
  };
   ```         
            
- Now, all request models require explicit constructor initialization. For example:
    ```csharp
  CreateOrderReq orderRequest = new CreateOrderReq(amount:10,currency:"EUR")
   ```  
Each constructor includes required parameters, which enforces stricter model validation during object creation

### 2. Separation of API Methods into Specific Clients

Several methods have been moved to distinct API client classes for better modularity and adherence to single-responsibility principles.

- **PaymentApiClient**:
  - Previously, all payment-related methods (e.g., `CreateTransfer`, `CreatePayment`, `CreatePayment`,`GetTransactions`...) were housed in this class.

#### Example:
```csharp
// Before:
var paymentApi = new PaymentApiClient();
paymentApi.GetTransactions(...);
paymentApi.SchedulePayment(...);


// Now:
var transactionApi = new TransactionApiClient();
transactionApi.GetTransactions(...);

var paymentDraftsApi = new PaymentDraftsApiClient();
transactionApi.CreatePaymentDraft(...);
```
 
For details about the methods available in each client, refer to the client-specific documentation below.


### 3. Changes in OrderApiClient (MerchantApi)

The request and response parameters for the `OrderApiClient` methods have been updated to align with the current Revolut API version (2024-09-01). This update includes revisions for better clarity, extensibility, and additional metadata in the response format. Be sure to review the updated method signatures and response handling logic when working with the `OrderApiClient`.

## Migration Guide

To update your existing codebase to comply with these changes:

### 1. Update Request Model Initialization:
- Refactor all model initializations to use constructors instead of object initializers.
- Review the required parameters for each model constructor.

### 2. Adapt to New API Client Structure:
- Replace calls to methods previously in `PaymentApiClient` with the respective client class (e.g., `TransferApiClient`, `TransactionApiClient`).
- Instantiate and use the appropriate client class for each specific operation.

### 3. Update OrderApiClient Usage:
- Review the updated request parameter structure and revise method calls accordingly.
- Adjust response parsing logic to accommodate new response formats.



# Notes
For merchant API you only need a merchant API key and API version

# Get NuGet Package
[RevolutAPI ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RevolutAPI/)

# Source code client setup
1. Clone RevolutLib from [GitHub](https://github.com/ssrdio/RevolutAPI) inside your project directory
2. Add the RevolutApi project to yout solution
3. Add a reference to the RevolutApi project


# Business API Setup 
## Authorization and Authentication
1. generate certificate on machine with openssl (bellow snippet in ubuntu)
```bash
openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -key privatekey.pem -out publickey.cer -days 1825
openssl pkcs12 -inkey privatekey.pem -in publickey.cer -export -out revolut_pfx.pfx
base64 revolut_pfx.pfx
```
2. copy public cert into revolut
```bash
cat publickey.cer
```
3. because .NET core currnetly does not support *.pem certificats we created pfx in previous step now what we need to to is just to base64 encode certificate and we paste it into our configuration
```bash
base64 revolut_pfx.pfx
```

4. Include nuget package

# Revolut API client usage
## Auth
This part requres manual work where we need to provide new authorization code every 90 days. 

Call function `AuthorizationApiClient.Authorize` providing all the parameters
```c#
// issuer shuld be without http or https
Result<AuthorizationCodeResp> authorisationResp = await authorizationApiClient.Authorize("base64enconced pfx cert","certificate password","your domain (issuer)", "clientId provided by revolut", "authorization code provided by revolut");
// here you save rerresh token
db.Save(authorisationResp.Value.RefreshToken);
```
## Normal usage 
```c#
RevolutApiClient revolutApiClient = new RevolutApiClient(settings.Value.RevolutSettings.Endpoint, new RevolutAPI.Models.Authorization.RefreshAccessTokenModel
{
    PrivateCert = "base64enconced pfx cert",
    CertificatePassword = "certificate password",
    ClientId =  "clientId provided by revolut",
    Issuer = "your domain (issuer)",
    RefreshToken = db.getLastRefreshToken()
}, memoryCache);

CounterPartiesApiClient counterPartiesApiClient = new CounterPartiesApiClient(revolutApiClient);
Result<AddNonRevolutCounterpartyResp> resp = await _counterPartyApiClient.CreateNonRevolutCounterparty(req);
```

# Running API client tests
In order to run tests you need to modify the `Config.cs` file in the RevolutApiTests project.
This file contains global values used during test execution. The values are:
* `ENDPOINT` - The endpoint used during testing
* `TOKEN` - The authorization token

The following values are used when testing the payment endpoints. 
* `ACCOUNT_ID` - Sender account
* `COUNTERPARTY_ID` - Reciever counterparty
* `COUNTERPARTY_ACCOUNT_ID` - Reciever counterparty account
* `CURRENCY` - Currencry used in the trasaction tests

NOTE: These values should be prexisting accounts and couterparties with a non-empty balance. The currencty should also match, otherwise the tests will fail.
